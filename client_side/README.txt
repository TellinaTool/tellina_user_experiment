Welcome to the Tellina User Experiment!

Tellina uses natural language processing (NLP) to translate an English sentence,
such as "Find text file in the current folder", into a bash command, such as
find . -name "*.txt".

Make sure you have read all information on the website about the experiment
before beginning. Once you are ready, run
```sh
source ./configure
```
