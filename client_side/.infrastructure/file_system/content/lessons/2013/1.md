## Lecture Notes

* Intro to Unix
* File system basics
* Common issues
* Where to find help

## Shell / Terminal

* Used for logging in via SSH (Secure Shell)  
`ssh username@cwolf.cs.sonoma.edu`

#### OSX

* Applications > Terminal or Spotlight > 'Terminal'
* [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/)

#### Windows

* [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
* [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/)

## [Unix File System](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/linux-file-system-structure/)

/   - root
/bin - user binaries  
/sbin - system binaries  
/etc - config files  
/dev - device files  
/proc - process info  
/var - variable files  
/tmp - temporary files  
/usr - user programs  
/home - home directories  
/boot - boot loader files  
/lib - system libraries  
/opt - optional add ons  
/mnt - mount  
/media - removable devices  
/srv - service data  

> __Notes:__  
> Files are case sensitive   
> File extensions are used to determine file type  
> Absolute path - A file path that contains the root directory including all folders leading up to the file.  
> Relative path - The partial path to a file relative to the current directory.  

## Navigation Lab

#### Basic Commands
* `cd <directory>` Change Directory
* `ls -l` List files and folders (List Sector)
* `pwd`Print Working Directory
* `cp <source> <destination>` Copy files and directories
* `mv <source> <destination>`Move or rename files
* `echo <some string>` | `echo <some string> > file.txt` Print string to console or redirect into file
* `rmdir <directory>` `mkdir <directory>`Remove directory
* `touch <filename>` Change time stamps and create new files
* `rm -i <file to delete>` Remove files and ask
* `rm -r <delete folder recursively>` Remove files and folders recursively
* `control c` Cancel
* `man <command>` | `info <command>` Open man (instruction) pages for a command
* `.` Current directory
* `..` Parent directory
* `~` Home Directory
* `control l` Clear Screen

> __Notes:__  
> The tab key can autocomplete file and folder names 

##### More Commands
* `pushd` Push current directory onto the stack
* `popd` Remove current directory off the stack
* `less` Used to view files with ability to scroll with `j` and `k`
* `more` Used for viewing files. Scroll using `space`
* `cat <file>` Read from file and used for file concatenation 
* `history` Display previous commands
* `who` Show who is logged on
* `whoami` Shows who the currently logged in user is
* `g++ <fileName.cpp> -o programName.x` Compile C++ file and output into programName.x

#### Home Directory
* dot files
* hidden files
	* bash_profile
	* bashrc
* public_html
* aliases -> (shortcuts)

#### Permissions
`rwxrwxrwx`  
`rwxr-xr-x`

#### [Chmod](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/06/chmod-command-examples/)

#### Tar (tape archive) - [Compression](http://xkcd.com/1168/)
Directory compression  
`[username@cwolf ~]$ tar cfvz destination.tgz source/`

File extraction  
`[username@cwolf ~]$ tar xf file.tgz`

## Common issues
* `control + z` by accident? Use `fg` to fix.
    * Zombing / Backgrounding tasks
* Control C to cancel
* Strange ssh messages when ssl cert changes - just the one line

``` 
cd ~/.ssh
pwd
/Users/username/.ssh
ls
known_hosts
vim known_hosts
```
Next find the line with the server you are trying to connect to.

1. Enter `/` and type "cwolf" press enter.
2. cwolf should now be highlighted
3. Type `d` twice to remove the line
4. Type `:wq` to write the changes to disk and quit

You should now be able to ssh again. If all else fails it is also safe to delete the `known_hosts` file.  
`rm known_hosts`

#### Extra Tips
* `Control`+`l` will clear the screen
* `Tab` will complete file names
* `Control + k` will cut all characters after the cursor position
* `Control + y` will paste after the cursor position
* `Control + n / p` will cycle through history `up arrow | down arrow`
* `Control + c` will cancel current
* `history | more` will let you view your previous commands
* `man <command>` will show the manual for a given command
