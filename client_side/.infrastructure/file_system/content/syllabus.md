## Makeup policy

## Exam Collaboration Policy
Exams must be your own work. You are allowed to consult only your own brain, your 8.5x11" handwritten cheat sheet, and other materials specifically permitted by the instructor. On both exams and quizzes, giving or receiving unpermitted aid will be penalized as academic dishonesty.

## Policy on Collaboration
You are encouraged to discuss course material with other students. Don't be shy about consulting with anyone, but please understand that you, and only you, bear the responsibility for solving the problems associated with producing a successful project or solving a homework assignment. Please read the CS Department policy on plagiarism and keep the following in mind.

* _All material turned in for credit must be your own work._ For the programs, you may discuss design issues with other students, but you must write your own solution to the problem at hand. Copying part or all of another student's work, with or without the student's knowledge, is prohibited.
