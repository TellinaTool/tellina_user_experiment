## Lab 8 - Git

* Init, Adding files, committing, diffing, recovering deleted files
* Pushing files to bitbucket and github

### Git Basic Setup
Setup your name and email address. These will show up in your commit logs. These steps only need to be done once per machine as they are global settings and apply to all git repositories accessed on the machine unless overridden.

`git config --global user.name "John Doe"`
`git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com`

Light up the terminal with some color  
`git config --global color.ui true` This will make all the differences show up with red and green. Red being removed with green as adds.
