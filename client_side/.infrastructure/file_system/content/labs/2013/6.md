This lab will go over the basics of standard input and output as well as covering how you can use pipes to connect the input and output of programs together.

# Part I - IO and Pipes

## Standard Input, Output & Error

> In computer programming, standard streams are preconnected input and output channels between a computer program and its environment (typically a text terminal) when it begins execution. The three I/O connections are called standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr). - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams)

### Standard input (stdin) 0

> Standard input is data (often text) going into a program. The program requests data transfers by use of the read operation. Not all programs require input. For example, the dir and ls programs (which display file names contained in a directory) perform their operations without any stream data input.  
>
> Unless redirected, input is expected from the keyboard which started the program. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams)

### Standard output (stdout) 1

> Standard output is the stream where a program writes its output data. The program requests data transfer with the write operation. Not all programs generate output. For example the file rename command (variously called mv, move, or ren) is silent on success.  
> 
> Unless redirected, standard output is the text terminal which initiated the program. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams)

### Standard error (stderr) 2

> Standard error is another output stream typically used by programs to output error messages or diagnostics. It is a stream independent of standard output and can be redirected separately. The usual destination is the text terminal which started the program to provide the best chance of being seen even if standard output is redirected (so not readily observed). For example, output of a program in a pipeline is redirected to input of the next program, but errors from each program still go directly to the text terminal.
> 
> It is acceptable-and normal-for standard output and standard error to be directed to the same destination, such as the text terminal. Messages appear in the same order as the program writes them, unless buffering is involved. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams)

### Examples

```
// C++ Example
// Standard Input
std::cin >> variable;

// Standard Output
std::cout << "Message to print on screen";

// Standard Error
std::cerr << "Error Message to be logged"
```

> When redirecting in the terminal note that using a single > will overwrite the contents of the destination file if it already exists. 
> Using >> will append to the bottom of an existing file

```
// Shell Example
// Standard Output
$ cat log.txt | sort 

// Standard Input
$ echo "Some String"  1> redirectedIntoThisFile.txt

// This is the same as above but the 1 is implied
$ echo "Some String"  > redirectedIntoThisFile.txt

// Standard Error
$ cat fileThatDoesntExist 2> error.txt

// Combined Output. This is done by using a & symbol instead of a file descriptor index.
$ cat fileThatDoesExist fileThatDoesntExist &> output.txt

// Split Output. This will put errors in errors.txt and sort the remaining output before storing in results.txt
$ cat fileThatDoesExist fileThatDoesntExist 2> errors.txt | sort > results.txt


// Overwriting a file
$ echo "Some string" > file.txt

// Appending to a file
$ echo "Another string" >> file.txt
$ cat redirectedIntoThisFile >> file.txt

```

Sometimes when running scripts the standard errors are not wanted. These can be suppressed by piping them into /dev/null.

> /dev/null is basically a black hole that discards all data written to it

Alternatively you could put these errors into a separate errors log file.

Alter the following command so that the errors are appended to a file named errorlog.txt and the desired standard output is appended to a file named output.txt. Put your answer in a file named redirect.txt

`ls -l *.html missingDirectoryName`

Copy `error.cpp` form `/home/faculty/mcarrier/pickup/cs210/lab06/error.cpp` into your lab folder

Compile and run this and redirect the output into two files errors.txt & results.txt.

Experiment using `cat` to merge errors.txt and results.txt so that the errors are on top. Multiple files into one named combined.txt

Read permissions of all files ending in html
`find ~/ -name "*.cpp" | xargs ls -l`

## Pipes
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">Pipes (wikipedia)</a>
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Pipeline.svg)

Pipes are used to allow for programs to communicate with one another by passing the output of one as input to another.

For large outputs which span across the screen pipes can be used to allow for scrolling or better control.

`ls -l | less` or `ls -l | more`

In this case here the output of ls will be pipped into grep which will then search for text containing "txt"  

`ls | grep txt`

Another use case may be to search through your history for a previously entered command

`history | grep <command>`

Combining with output redirection new files can be created from the output of older ones

`sort < unsortedFile.txt`

Multiple redirections can occur in a single line.

`sort < unsortedFile.txt > sortedOuput.txt`

1. Using what you have learned about pipes display your top 15 used terminal commands sorted by use count in ascending order. Put your results and answer in pipes.txt

2. Using pipes print out the first and last name of all the people who recently logged onto cwolf sorted by last name. You can use the `last` command to get a list of user names. Add your command and answer in pipes.txt

__Example of top 15 commands output:__
	
	  87  git checkout master
	  90  stree
	  91  git add .
	  96  git pull
	  99  fg
	 100  pwd
	 113  make
	 133  ls -la
	 156  git log
	 202  clear
	 215  cd ..
	 272  ls -l
	 302  git diff
	1014  ls
	1125  git status
