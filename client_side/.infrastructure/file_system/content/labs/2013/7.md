# Part II - Markdown

In this section you will learn the following:

* How to host files in the public_html directory
* How to use markdown to easily create a simple webpages
* Use grep and awk to extract links from html

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber with substantial contributions from Aaron Swartz,[4] allowing people “to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)…   
- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

Download the markdown conversion script from here with curl

`curl http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/Markdown_1.0.1.zip > Markdown.zip`

Next use unzip to extract the zip file. This is another utility like tar.

`unzip Markdown.zip`

cd into the extracted folder and download a sample file to play with.

`curl http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text > sample.md`

Next run the markdown script passing in sample.md as an argument

`./markdown.pl sample.md`

Notice how it prints the output to the console. 

1. Create a new file named `cs210sample.md`
2. Copy the list of your top 15 unix commands to it. Use the list format specified in the markdown sample.
3. Add some notes about pipes and redirection to the file.
4. Run the markdown.pl script on the file and redirect this into a file named `cs210sample.html`
5. If the file doesn't already exist in your home directory create a folder named `public_html`.  
6. Copy `cs210sample.html` to it and attempt to view it from a browser by using the following url:
`http://www.cs.sonoma.edu/~username/cs210sample.html`

> __NOTE:__ You can use this space in the future for keeping notes or creating a website.  
> Creating a file named `index.html` and placing it in `public_html` will allow you to visit your site by just entering. `http://www.cs.sonoma.edu/~username/` into a browser.  
> You may need to adjust the permissions on the public_html folder and the sample.html file.
> To Adjust your permissions on your folder run the following commands from your home directory.  
> `cd ~`  
> `chmod 755 public_html`  
> `cd public_html`  
> `chmod 644 *`  
> Try to access the page again. The Forbidden Message should now be gone.  

The submission for this part is to have some html in this location. `http://www.cs.sonoma.edu/~username/cs210sample.html`. I'll be running a script which downloads each sample page. Make sure that you are able to access the page from a browser.

_How would use pipes download each persons cs210sample.html file given a list of the usernames in the class?_
