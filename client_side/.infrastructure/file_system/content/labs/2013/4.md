To restore old settings to the bash profile follow the following steps:

`cp /home/faculty/mcarrier/pickup/bash_old.txt ~/bash_old.txt`

In your home directory we are going to append the contents of the bash_old profile to the bottom of the new one.

> The >> will append the contents of `bash_old.txt` the bottom of the `.bash_profile`. 

`cat ~/bash_old.txt >> ~/.bash_profile`

Open your .bash_profile using `tail -n 20 ~/.bash_profile`

You should now see the following at the bottom:

```

# .bash_profile

# Get the aliases and functions
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
	. ~/.bashrc
fi

# User specific environment and startup programs

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin

export PATH

```
