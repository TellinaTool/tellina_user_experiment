# Lab 10.24

## Shell Scripting

* Soft Links
* Path Adjustment
* Scripting basics

### Part 1 - Dotfiles

1. Create a new folder in your home directory named `dotfiles`
2. Initialize a git repository in the folder
3. Copy your `.vimrc` or `.emacs`, and `.bash_profile` into the directory. Make all these files non hidden by renaming them without the dot in the beginning.
4. Add and commit these files to the git repo.
5. Create a script named `setup.sh` which creates soft links to each of the setting files into your home directory. The linked should all be prefixed with a dot in front of them, but not in the dotfiles folder. See sample output below.
	* The script should backup any existing dotfiles you plan on replacing into a backup folder 
6. Run `chmod 700 setup.sh` to make it executable.
7. Running `ls -la` in the home directory should show something like this:

	__Sample__
	
	```

	.bash_profile -> /home/student/username/dotfiles/bash_profile
	.vimrc -> /home/student/username/dotfiles/vimrc

	
	```
8. Add `setup.sh` to the dot files git repo.
9. Create a new repository on Github named `dot files`.
10. Add github as a new remote to your local dotfiles repo.
11. Push all your changes up to github.

### Part 2 - Setup Script

#### Project Template Requirements
* Creates a new directory using the name the script takes in as an argument.
* The directory created must be a git repository which initializes and adds all the files in it with a commit once the script is at the end.
* A read me file with a header containing the project name, your user name and date should be added.

#### Steps
1. Create a folder in your home directory named `scripts`
1. Create a shell script in your scripts folder named `newproject.sh` When invoked the script will create a new directory containing a basic project or lab setup.
1. Create a bin folder in your home directory and create a soft link to the script in the scripts folder.
1. Run `chmod 700` on the `newproject.sh` to make it executable
1. Modify your PATH to include the bin folder if it isn't already there. This should be done in your `.bash_profile`
	`PATH=$PATH:/home/students/username/bin`
1. You should now be able to run the command `newproject` from any folder and quickly setup a base environment for labs or projects.
