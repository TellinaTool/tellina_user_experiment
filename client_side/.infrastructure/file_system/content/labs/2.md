# Lab 2

## Topics
* File system basics
* File system navigation
* File and Folder Creation
* File and Folder Deletion
* Script Creation
* File Permissions
* Markdown
* Basic Git Commands

## Goals
* Practice basic command line tasks
    * file and directory creation
    * deleting files and directories
    * renaming
    * moving
    * deleting
* Shell scripting basics
    * Execution
    * Permissions

## Deliverables
* A shell script which will setup a new project directory The script should do the following:
    * The script will ask for the name of the project or lab
    * The script will ask the number the lab or project is
    * Creates a new directory with the name given above including the number at the end
    * Creates a file named README.md in the directory which contains the first and last name of the logged in user, date, and project title.

The script will look like this when you are done:

```
$ ./createWorkspace
$ What is the project name?
carrier_L01
$ Creating new workspace named "carrier_L01"
$ Created README.md
$ ls carrier_L01
README.md
$ cat carrier_L01/README.md

A common task you will encounter for most of your classes is having to
create a lab or project directory with a README.txt or README.md file
as well as a "makefile" to compile your programs. It would be nice
if there was a way to automate creating some of these directories and
files for each lab and project we work on.

First lets setup a folder for the CS210 class in your home directory if
you have not already have.

`cd ~` This will take you to your home directory ex: `/home/username`

Create a new directory for the Unix class with the following command
`mkdir cs210`

Next create a new folder named your_last_name_lab02
`mkdir your_last_name_lab02`

While we have created the new directory we actually want it to be inside
of the cs210 folder. In order to move the folder use the mv command.
`mv your_last_name_lab02 cs210`

The next item needed is a readme file. This file should contain your
First and last name at the very top followed by the date and then the lab or project number.

There are two different approaches we can take to create this file.

* Manually create a new file with your name, date, and project with a text editor.
* Redirect the standard output of the terminal into a new file.
    
The manual way is pretty easy to figure out. Open a text editor, add the stuff needed and save the file. 

To redirect the standard output of the terminal into a file enter the following commands:

```
finger $USER | grep Name | awk '{ print $4,$5 }' > README.md
date >> README.md
echo "Lab 2" >> README.md
```

The first line of this does several commands at once. This is called piping. What it allows you to do is chain several commands together redirecting the output of one program to be input of another.

Each command or program between the pipe symbol `|` can be ran on its own to see what it will do. In this case we are extracting the first and last name of the currently logged in user account `$USER` listed by `finger` by using `grep` and `awk`.

`grep` Lets you search for strings of text extracting matches out of any row that contains your string while `awk` lets you print specific columns of text. $4,$5 represents the columns that contain the first and last name. $0 prints all the columns.

Finally the `>` symbol at the very end redirects the final result into a file instead of printing it to the screen. If the file doesn't exist it is created. If the file already exists it is overwritten with the contents of the output to the left. To append to the bottom use `>>` 

The `date` command will print the current date and `>>` will append that output to the end of the `README.md` file. (md stands for [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown))

Finally we use the `echo` command followed by a string to add to the very end of the file.

If we already know some of the information is never going to change or is going to be reused for a few items we can automate some of this by storing it into a variable. `$USER` is an environmental variable which contains your username. We can make our own variables by assigning string values to new variables like as follows:

`export ASSIGNMENT_TITLE="My Project or Lab Title"`
It can then be referenced by using the `$`
`echo $ASSIGNMENT_TITLE`

If we want to read input into a variable we can use the `read` command followed by a variable.

```
read MY_VARIABLE_NAME
$ <User input here...>
echo $MY_VARIABLE_NAME

```

All of the above commands we have learned so far we can write down in a shell script that can be executed in the shell like any other program.

Create a new file named `createWorkspace.sh`

Inside the script file ask the user to enter a project or lab title and 
read this into a variable.

Use this variable to generate a new folder with the same name, and a readme file inside the folder containing the same name date and project title using the same commands we used above. You can use the `mv` command to move the README.md file into the project folder. Ex: `mv README.md $ASSIGNMENT_TITLE`

Before we can execute the script we will need to change the permissions to make it executable. To do this run either of the follow commands:

`chmod 700 createWorkspace.sh` or `chmod u+x createWorkspace.sh`
You can run ls -l to confirm that the createWorkspace.sh file has executable permissions. Once it does running `source createWorkspace.sh` or `./createWorkspace.sh` should execute the script.

When you have successfully executed the script you can check to see if the new directory was created by typing `ls` You should see a new directory name containing the README file.

To delete the new project directory and the files inside of it use: `rmdir <directory name>` You should get an erro when trying to do this. `rmdir` will not delete a directory which contains files.

Go into the directory using `cd <directory name>` Then run `rm README.md` Then use `cd ..` to navigate back up to the parent folder. You should now be able to run `rmdir`

Having to delete all the files manually from a directory can be painful if there are many files. So in the future you can use `rm -rf <directory name>`. This will force delete the folder and all items inside of it recursively. Use this command with care!

After you have confirmed the script is properly working we need to save it in source control. We will be doing more with this in a future lab.

Type `git init` in your project folder. This will initialize a new `git` repository to keep track of changes. Next type `git status` to see the files that are 'untracked'. Type `git add createWorkspace.sh` to stage the file. Then type `git commit -m "Initial commit of workspace creation script"`

Typing `git show` should give you some output which shows a bunch of +'s and green text showing the file that you just added. Sign up for a [github](http://github.com) account. Next create a new repository to push your files up to. There are instructions on the site on how to do this after creating a new repository. 

1. Click the + on the top right "New repository"
2. Give it a name of "create-workspace"
3. Click Create repository
4. Follow the instructions under "Push an existing repository from the command line"
5. Visit the repo by going to your home page by clicking on your name.

Once you have successfully pushed your repository up to github and can view your changes on the site check in with me so I can mark you off. I'll need your Github user name to mark you off.
