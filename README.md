# Tellina User Experiment

## Directory explanation
- `server_side`: the code used for the server side of the experiment, this
  includes both the post handler and the post-processor.
- `client_side`: this is the directory that contains the files to be distributed
  to the users of the experiment.

## Distributing experiment
To distribute the files, run `make` or `make all`. This will run all tests and create the `.zip` file for distribution.
  - The `DIST_NAME` variable in the [Makefile](Makefile) specifies the name of the `.zip` file that will be created.
  - The structure of the experiment archive is specified [the experiment design doc](experiment_design_doc.md#directory-structure).
