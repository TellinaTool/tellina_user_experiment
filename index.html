  <h1>
    Welcome to the English to Bash Experiment website!
  </h1>
  <p>
    For the experiment to go as smoothly as possible, please ensure that you have access to a <a
      href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/lab/software/linuxhomevm">CSE Linux Home VM</a> with <a
      href="https://meldmerge.org/">Meld</a> installed. You can verify if Meld is installed by using the Meld command in
    your VM's terminal: <code>$ meld</code>. It should open a GUI window. To install Meld on your CSE Linux Home VM use
    <code>$ sudo yum install meld</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will be presented with a series of file system tasks that can be done within a Bash shell.
    For each task, you are encouraged to use a variety of tools (man pages, Google, etc.) to help you solve it. Your
    objective is to solve each task with a Bash one-liner: a bash script that is contained on one line. E.g.,
    <code>$ ls | tee file</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Once all of those prerequisites are met and you are ready, please follow these step to start the experiment:
  <ol>
    <li>Download <a href="experiment.zip">experiment.zip</a> in a convenient folder on your CSE Linux Home VM.</li>
    <li>Unzip with <code>$ unzip experiment.zip</code></li>
    <li>Start the experiment <code>$ source bash_experiment/configure</code></li>
  </ol>
  When you start the experiment, follow the prompts in your terminal. You will have 2 training questions to familiarize yourself with the tool and then the real tasks.
  </p>
